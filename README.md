DEZSYS04 - JAVA NAMING AND DIRECTORY INTERFACE (JNDI)

Follow the introduction and instructions of the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) described in this tutorial https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/TOC.html.

Setup your own or use an pre-existing naming service and implement following operations:

Lookup an Object (1)
List the Context (1)
Add, Replace or Remove a Binding (2)
Rename (1)
Create and Destroy Subcontexts (1)
Attribute Names (1)
Read Attributes (1)
Modify Attributes (1)
Add, Replace Bindings with Attributes (2)
Search
* Basic Search (1)
* Filters (1)
* Scope (1)
* Result Count (1)
* Time Limit (1)
Create a protocol in which you describe 1) your installation steps, 2) source code snippets used to perform the naming operations and 3) result of each operation. Pack the protocol and sources into a JAR file and upload it here.

Size of Group: 2 persons
(if you work without a team member then I will recommend to use the name service of another group)
